-- SQL Advanced Practice by mohammedyk7
-- Topics: UNION, DELETE vs DROP vs TRUNCATE, Subqueries, Transactions, ACID
-- ===================================

-- ====== PART 1: UNION Practice ======

-- 1. List all unique people (trainees or applicants) using UNION
SELECT FullName, Email FROM Trainees
UNION
SELECT FullName, Email FROM Applicants;

-- 2. Use UNION ALL and observe duplicates
SELECT FullName, Email FROM Trainees
UNION ALL
SELECT FullName, Email FROM Applicants;
-- Observation: Layla Al Riyami appears twice because she exists in both tables.

-- 3. Find people who are in both tables (by Email)
SELECT T.FullName, T.Email
FROM Trainees T
INNER JOIN Applicants A ON T.Email = A.Email;

-- ====== PART 2: DROP, DELETE, TRUNCATE ======

-- 4. DELETE specific rows
DELETE FROM Trainees WHERE Program = 'Outsystems';
-- Observation: Table remains. Only matching row(s) are deleted.

-- 5. TRUNCATE table
TRUNCATE TABLE Applicants;
-- Observation: All data is deleted. Cannot rollback if not in a transaction.

-- 6. DROP table
DROP TABLE Applicants;
-- Observation: Table is completely removed. SELECT from it causes an error.

-- ====== PART 3: Subqueries and Transactions ======

-- 1. Subquery in WHERE clause (find trainees also in applicants)
SELECT * FROM Trainees
WHERE Email IN (SELECT Email FROM Applicants);

-- 2. DELETE using subquery (delete applicants who are also trainees)
DELETE FROM Applicants
WHERE Email IN (SELECT Email FROM Trainees);

-- 3. Transaction block with intentional failure
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO Applicants VALUES (104, 'Zahra Al Amri', 'zahra.a@example.com', 'Referral', '2025-05-10');
INSERT INTO Applicants VALUES (104, 'Error User', 'error@example.com', 'Website', '2025-05-11'); -- Duplicate ID

-- Uncomment based on test result:
-- COMMIT;
-- ROLLBACK;

-- 4. ACID Properties Summary (write your answer here as comments)
-- Atomicity: All steps succeed or fail together. Like a bank transfer: debit + credit.
-- Consistency: DB remains valid before and after transaction. No broken rules.
-- Isolation: Transactions donâ€™t interfere. Like two ATMs working on same account safely.
-- Durability: Once committed, changes survive crash. Like saving a doc and power goes out.
